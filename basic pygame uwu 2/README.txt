GAME INSTRUCTIONS
You start with 60hp and have to defeat 5 levels filled with monsters.

Monsters will make attacks to deplete your hp. The amount of damage is indicated above the monster's head.

Your starting deck consists of 3 cards: 2 Scratch cards and 1 Fireball card. You can add any of 3 cards into your deck after each battle.

Each turn, you have 3 energy. Each card costs energy to play. You can use any of the top 3 cards in your deck.

Attacks that target 1 enemy will target the leftmost one.

After your deck is used up, it will randomly shuffle itself. The deck will also shuffle each new battle.

W icon in the upper right is your winstreak, meaning the number of times you've won in a row.

Start by clicking the black enemy icon. Good luck and have fun!
